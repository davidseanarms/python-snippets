# Write a Python function called divide_or_square that takes one argument (a number),
# and returns the square root of the number if it is divisible by 5, returns its remainder if it is not divisible by 5.
# For example, if you pass 10 as an argument, then your function should return 3.16 as the square root.

def divide_or_square(number):
  if number % 5 == 0:
    return (number ** 0.5)
  else:
    return number % 5

print(divide_or_square(10))

    return f'The square-root of the number is {sq_root}'
  else:
